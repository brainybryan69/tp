## Design

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="550" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="550"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="550" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="550"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Transaction Management

The transaction management feature allows users to add and delete financial transactions associated with a person in the address book. This is useful for tracking income and expenses related to a contact.

#### Add Transaction Command (`addtxn`)

The `addtxn` command adds a new transaction to a person. The implementation involves parsing the user input, creating a `Transaction` object, and adding it to the person's transaction list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Add Transaction Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `addtxn` command word and passes the arguments to the `AddTransactionCommandParser`.
2.  **Index and Transaction Creation:** The `AddTransactionCommandParser` parses the person's index, transaction name, and amount to create an `AddTransactionCommand` object.
3.  **Execution:** The `AddTransactionCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the updated transaction list.
5.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object.



The `deletetxn` command removes a transaction from a person. The implementation is similar to `addtxn`, but it removes the transaction from the person's transaction list instead of adding one.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTransactionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Transaction Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `deletetxn` command word and passes the arguments to the `DeleteTransactionCommandParser`.
2.  **Index and Transaction Creation:** The `DeleteTransactionCommandParser` parses the person's index and the transaction's index to create a `DeleteTransactionCommand` object.
3.  **Execution:** The `DeleteTransactionCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the transaction removed from the transaction list.
5.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object.

#### Edit Transaction Command (`editTxn`)

The `editTxn` command edits an existing transaction of a person. The implementation involves parsing the user input, creating an `EditTransactionDescriptor` object, and updating the transaction in the person's transaction list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/EditTransactionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Edit Transaction Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `editTxn` command word and passes the arguments to the `EditTransactionCommandParser`.
2.  **Index and Descriptor Creation:** The `EditTransactionCommandParser` parses the person's index, transaction index, and the fields to be edited to create an `EditTransactionCommand` object.
3.  **Execution:** The `EditTransactionCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Transaction Update:** A new `Transaction` object is created with the updated details.
5.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the updated transaction list.
6.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object.


### FollowUp Management

The follow up management feature allows users to add and delete follow up tasks associated with a person in the address book. This is useful for tracking follow up tasks related to a contact.

#### Add FollowUp Command (`addfu`)

The `addfu` command adds a new follow-up to a person. The implementation involves parsing the user input, creating a `FollowUp` object, and adding it to the person's follow up list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/AddFollowUpSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Add Follow Up Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `addfu` command word and passes the arguments to the `AddFollowUpCommandParser`.
2.  **Index and FollowUp Creation:** The `AddFollowUpCommandParser` parses the person's index, follow-up name, and urgency to create an  `AddFollowUpCommand` object.
3.  **Execution:** The `AddFollowUpCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the updated follow-up list.
5.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object.



The `deletefu` command removes a follow-up from a person. The implementation is similar to `addfu`, but it removes the follow-up from the person's follow-up list instead of adding one.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteFollowUpSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete FollowUp Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `deletefu` command word and passes the arguments to the `DeleteFollowUpCommandParser`.
2.  **Index and FollowUp Creation:** The `DeleteFollowUpCommandParser` parses the person's index and the follow-up's index to create a `DeleteFollowUpCommand` object.
3.  **Execution:** The `DeleteFollowUpCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the follow-up removed from the follow-up list.
5.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object.

### Data archiving

The archive management feature allows users to archive and unarchive persons in the address book. This is useful for maintaining a clean view of active contacts while preserving information about inactive or past contacts.

#### Archive Command (`archive`)

The `archive` command moves all the people from the active address book to the archived list.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Archive Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `archive` command word and creates an `ArchiveCommand` object.`.
3.  **Execution:** The `ArchiveCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the archive status set to archived.
5.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object, moving them to the archived list.

#### Unarchive Command (`unarchive`)

The `unarchive` command restores a person from the archived list back to the active address book. The implementation is similar to `archive`, but it changes the person's archive status from archived to active.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

<puml src="diagrams/UnarchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Unarchive Sequence Diagram" width="550" />

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Parsing:** The `AddressBookParser` identifies the `unarchive` command word and passes the arguments to the `UnarchiveCommandParser`.
2.  **Index Parsing:** The `UnarchiveCommandParser` parses the person's index to create an `UnarchiveCommand` object.
3.  **Execution:** The `UnarchiveCommand` retrieves the `Person` from the archived list in the `Model` using the provided index.
4.  **Person Update:** A new `Person` object is created with the archive status set to active.
5.  **Model Update:** The `Model` is updated with the new `Person` object, moving them back to the active list.

## Appendix: Project Effort

### Overview
The development of Atlas represented a significant step-up in complexity from the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) project. While AB3 manages a single entity (`Person`), Atlas is designed to handle multiple, interconnected entities: `Person`, `Transaction`, and `FollowUp`. This multi-entity architecture introduced substantial challenges and required a greater development effort.

### Key Challenges
*   **Complex Data Modeling**: The core challenge was designing and implementing the one-to-many relationships between a `Person` and their associated `Transaction` and `FollowUp` entities. This required careful data structure design and robust dependency management for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
*   **Feature Complexity**:
    *   **Financial Tracking**: We built a complete transaction management system from the ground up, including logic for income/expense tracking, balance calculations, and a `summary` command for net cash flow analysis.
    *   **Task Management**: The priority-based `FollowUp` system, with its color-coded UI and persistent storage, added another layer of complexity not present in AB3.
    *   **Data Archiving**: The `archive` and `unarchive` features required implementing a dual-storage strategy, careful state management, and robust file I/O to prevent data loss.

### Effort Breakdown
The estimated effort distribution for major components is as follows:
*   **Core Entity Management (30%)**: Extending the single-entity architecture to support multiple related entities.
*   **Financial Transaction System (25%)**: Implementing transaction logic, CRUD operations, and summary calculations.
*   **Follow-up Management (20%)**: Building the priority-based task system and UI integration.
*   **Archive System (15%)**: Developing the archive/unarchive functionality and file management.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements (10%)**: Adapting the GUI to display nested entity lists within the main contact cards.

### Strategic Reuse
We leveraged existing libraries and patterns to focus our efforts on core features, saving an estimated **15% of development time**.
*   **Jackson Library**: Utilized for JSON serialization and deserialization for both primary (`addressbook.json`) and archive (`archive.json`) data. Our custom adaptations are encapsulated in the `JsonUtil` class and associated entity-specific serializers.
*   **JavaFX & Command Pattern**: We reused the foundational UI components and command architecture from AB3. However, these were significantly extended. For example, the `PersonCard` was heavily modified to display nested data, and numerous complex commands (`AddTransactionCommand`, `ArchiveCommand`, etc.) were built on top of the base pattern.

### Summary of Achievements
Despite the increased complexity, we successfully delivered a robust application with:
*   A **fully functional multi-entity management system** for contacts, transactions, and follow-ups.
*   **Integrated financial tracking** with summary reporting.
*   **Intuitive, priority-driven task management**.
*   **Safe data preservation** through an archive/unarchive system.
*   **Comprehensive test coverage** that meets AB3's high standards while covering all new features.

In summary, while AB3 provided a solid architectural foundation, Atlas required approximately **2.5 times the implementation effort** due to its multi-entity data model, complex business logic, and advanced data management features.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

**Team size:** 5

1. **Add confirmation dialog for archive command:** Currently, the `archive` command immediately clears all contacts from the display without asking for confirmation. We plan to add a confirmation prompt that displays the number of contacts to be archived and requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding. For example:
   ```
   > archive
   Warning: You are about to archive 25 contacts. This will clear your current contact list.
   Type 'archive confirm' to proceed, or any other command to cancel.
   ```

2. **Make unarchive handle merge conflicts:** Currently, if the user has active contacts and runs `unarchive`, the behavior when contacts with duplicate phone numbers or emails exist is undefined. We plan to implement a merge strategy that shows a warning message listing conflicting contacts and asks the user whether to skip duplicates or replace existing contacts. For example:
   ```
   > unarchive
   Warning: 3 contacts in the archive conflict with existing contacts:
   - John Doe (same email: john@example.com)
   - Jane Smith (same phone: 91234567)
   Would you like to: [skip/replace/merge]
   ```

3. **Allow editing of follow-up priority:** Currently, once a follow-up is added, users cannot change its priority level without deleting and re-adding it. We plan to add an `editfu` command that allows users to modify the follow-up name and/or priority. Format: `editfu i/PERSON_INDEX f/FOLLOWUP_INDEX [n/NEW_NAME] [u/NEW_PRIORITY]`. For example:
   ```
   > editfu i/1 f/2 u/HIGH
   Follow-up priority updated: "Check delivery status" changed from MEDIUM to HIGH priority
   ```

4. **Add follow-up sorting by priority:** Currently, follow-ups are displayed in the order they were added, which may not reflect their urgency. We plan to automatically sort follow-ups on each contact card by priority (HIGH first, then MEDIUM, then LOW) to make urgent tasks more visible. The display will show:
   ```
   Follow-ups:
   [RED] Call supplier urgently (HIGH)
   [RED] Confirm order details (HIGH)
   [YELLOW] Review contract (MEDIUM)
   [GREEN] Send thank you note (LOW)
   ```

5. **Make archive operations preserve contact order:** Currently, when using `unarchive`, contacts may not be restored in their original order. We plan to preserve the exact ordering of contacts as they appeared before archiving, including any custom sorting that was applied. This will maintain visual consistency for users who rely on contact positioning.

6. **Add validation for duplicate follow-up names per contact:** Currently, users can add multiple follow-ups with identical names to the same contact, which can cause confusion. We plan to add validation that prevents adding a follow-up if another follow-up with the exact same name (case-insensitive) already exists for that contact. For example:
   ```
   > addfu i/1 f/Call supplier u/HIGH
   Error: A follow-up named "Call supplier" already exists for this contact.
   Please use a different name or delete the existing follow-up first.
   ```

7. **Enhance transaction summary to show income vs expense breakdown:** Currently, the `summary` command only shows the net cashflow as a single number. We plan to enhance it to display a breakdown showing total income, total expenses, and net cashflow separately. For example:
   ```
   > summary
   Financial Summary:
   Total Income: $5,250.00
   Total Expenses: $3,120.50
   Net Cashflow: +$2,129.50
   ```

8. **Add date/timestamp to follow-ups:** Currently, follow-ups have no time tracking, making it difficult to know when they were created or when they should be completed. We plan to add an optional due date field when creating follow-ups and display creation timestamps. Format: `addfu i/PERSON_INDEX f/FOLLOWUP_NAME u/PRIORITY [d/DUE_DATE]`. Display example:
   ```
   Follow-ups:
   [RED] Call supplier urgently (HIGH) - Due: 2025-11-05, Created: 2025-10-28
   ```

9. **Make follow-up deletion request confirmation for HIGH priority tasks:** Currently, deleting any follow-up happens immediately without confirmation, which could lead to accidental deletion of critical tasks. We plan to add a confirmation step only for HIGH priority follow-ups. For example:
   ```
   > deletefu i/1 f/1
   Warning: You are about to delete a HIGH priority follow-up: "Call supplier urgently"
   Type 'deletefu i/1 f/1 confirm' to proceed, or any other command to cancel.
   ```

10. **Add archive information display command:** Currently, users cannot view what's in the archive without running `unarchive`, which would overwrite their current contacts. We plan to add an `archiveinfo` command that displays summary information about archived contacts without loading them. For example:
   ```
   > archiveinfo
   Archive Summary:
   Total Contacts: 45
   Last Archived: 2025-09-15 14:30
   Total Transactions: 128
   Total Follow-ups: 23 (8 HIGH, 10 MEDIUM, 5 LOW)
   Archive Location: /data/archive.json
   ```
