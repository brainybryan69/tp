Welcome to **Atlas**, the desktop management tool designed specifically for F&B business owners.

Running a food and beverage business means juggling countless relationships: 

**Suppliers, customers, delivery partners, employees, and landlords.**

A simple address book just isn't enough.

Atlas is built to handle this complexity, combining contact management with essential business operations. 
It's designed for speed and efficiency, optimized for a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still providing the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you're comfortable typing, you can manage your operations significantly faster than with traditional mouse-based applications.

* If you are interested in using Atlas, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Atlas, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
